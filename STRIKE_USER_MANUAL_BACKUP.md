2. Ask questions about:
   - Lead information
   - System features
   - Data analysis
   - Recommendations
   - User manual and help documentation
   - Database queries in natural language
3. The chatbot can:

   - Troubleshoot common issues by referencing documentation
   - Convert natural language questions into database queries

#### Natural Language Database Queries

One of the most powerful features of the STRIKE chatbot is its ability to translate natural language questions into SQL database queries. This allows you to retrieve information from your CRM database without needing to know SQL:

1. **Ask Data Questions Naturally**: Simply ask questions like:
   - "How many leads do we have from the technology sector?"
   - "Show me all tasks assigned to Sarah that are due this week"
   - "What's the average lead score for leads acquired in the last month?"
   - "Which sales rep has the highest conversion rate this quarter?"

2. **How It Works**:
   - The chatbot analyzes your question to determine if it requires database access
   - It automatically generates an appropriate SQL query
   - The query is executed securely against your database
   - Results are formatted and presented in a readable format
   - The chatbot provides additional context and insights about the data

3. **Security Measures**:
   - All queries are limited to read-only operations (SELECT statements only)
   - Queries are sanitized to prevent SQL injection
   - Access is restricted based on user permissions
   - All database interactions are logged for security auditing

4. **Example Interactions**:

   *User*: "How many high-priority tasks are overdue?"
   
   *Chatbot*: "There are 12 high-priority tasks currently overdue. Here's the breakdown by assignee:
   - John Smith: 5 tasks
   - Sarah Johnson: 4 tasks
   - Michael Brown: 3 tasks
   
   Would you like to see the details of these tasks?"

   *User*: "Show me leads from California with a score above 80"
   
   *Chatbot*: "I found 8 leads from California with a score above 80. Here are the top 3 by score:
   1. Acme Corporation (Score: 95) - Last contacted: 2 days ago
   2. TechSolutions Inc (Score: 92) - Last contacted: 1 week ago
   3. Pacific Innovations (Score: 88) - Last contacted: 3 days ago
   
   Would you like to see the full list or get more details about any of these leads?"

#### Chatbot Interface Controls

The chatbot interface includes several controls for easy interaction:

1. **Minimize Button**: Click the minimize button (−) in the top-right corner of the chatbot window to collapse it back to the chat icon. You can reopen it anytime by clicking the chat icon again.
2. **Clear Conversation**: Click the trash icon to clear the current conversation history and start fresh.
3. **Copy to Clipboard**: Each message has a copy icon that appears on hover, allowing you to copy specific responses.

### Lead Scoring

STRIKE uses a sophisticated AI-powered lead scoring system to help you prioritize your sales efforts:

1. **Scoring Range**: Leads are scored on a scale of 1-100:
   - 80-100: Hot leads (high probability of conversion)
   - 50-79: Warm leads (moderate probability)
   - 20-49: Cool leads (lower probability)
   - 1-19: Cold leads (very low probability)

2. **Scoring Factors**: The AI considers multiple data points when calculating scores:
   - **Engagement Metrics** (40% weight):
     - Email open and response rates
     - Website visits (frequency and duration)
     - Content downloads and interaction
     - Form submissions
     - Chat interactions
   
   - **Demographic Fit** (25% weight):
     - Industry alignment with your target markets
     - Company size and revenue
     - Job title and decision-making authority
     - Geographic location
   
   - **Behavioral Signals** (20% weight):
     - Specific pages visited (pricing, product details)
     - Time spent on high-intent pages
     - Repeated visits to key conversion pages
     - Engagement with bottom-funnel content
    
   - **Communication Sentiment** (10% weight):
     - Positive language in communications
     - Response time to your outreach
     - Questions indicating buying intent
   
   - **External Data** (5% weight):
     - Social media activity
     - Company news and growth indicators
     - Market conditions

3. **Score Visibility**:
   - Lead scores are prominently displayed on lead cards and profiles
   - Color-coding provides quick visual reference (red: cold, yellow: cool, green: warm, blue: hot)
   - Hover over scores to see a breakdown of contributing factors
   - Historical score tracking shows progression over time

4. **Using Lead Scores**:
   - Sort lead lists by score to prioritize outreach
   - Filter dashboard views to focus on specific score ranges
   - Set up alerts for score changes above a certain threshold
   - Create segments based on score ranges for targeted campaigns
   - Track conversion rates by initial and current scores

5. **Score Recalculation**:
   - Scores are automatically updated daily
   - Significant interactions trigger immediate recalculation
   - Manual recalculation can be triggered from the lead profile

6. **Score Customization**:
   - Administrators can adjust factor weights in Settings > Lead Scoring
   - Industry-specific scoring models can be selected
   - Custom scoring factors can be added based on your unique business needs
   - A/B test different scoring models to optimize for your sales process

### Automated Workflows for Low Probability Clients

STRIKE includes powerful automation capabilities specifically designed to nurture low probability leads efficiently without consuming valuable sales team resources:

1. **Low Probability Classification**:

   - **Frequency Control**: Optimized contact frequency to maintain presence without overwhelming
   - **Multi-Channel Approach**: Coordinated outreach across email, SMS, and social touchpoints
   - **Personalization**: AI-generated personalized content based on lead characteristics and behavior

3. **Workflow Configuration**:
   - Access workflow settings in **Settings > Automation > Low Probability Workflows**
   - Create multiple workflows for different types of low probability leads
   - Set entry and exit conditions based on score thresholds and behaviors
   - Configure content sequences with conditional logic
   - Set maximum workflow duration (typically 90-180 days)
   - Define success metrics and conversion paths

4. **Monitoring and Optimization**:
   - **Performance Dashboard**: Track key metrics for low probability workflows
   - **Engagement Analytics**: Monitor open rates, click-through rates, and response patterns
   - **Conversion Tracking**: Measure how many low probability leads convert to higher scores
   - **A/B Testing**: Compare different nurture approaches for continuous improvement
   - **ROI Calculation**: Measure resource investment against conversion outcomes

5. **Re-Engagement Triggers**:
   - **Score Improvements**: Leads that reach a score of 40+ are automatically flagged for sales review
   - **Buying Signals**: Specific high-intent actions trigger alerts regardless of overall score
   - **Timing Indicators**: Responses indicating changed timeframes accelerate follow-up
   - **Manual Overrides**: Sales team can manually move leads out of automated workflows at any time

6. **Exit Strategies**:
   - **Successful Conversion**: Leads showing renewed interest move to active sales workflows
   - **Time-Based Exit**: Leads with no engagement after configured timeframe (default: 120 days)
   - **Explicit Opt-Out**: Leads requesting no further contact
   - **Disqualification**: Leads confirmed as poor fits after additional data collection

7. **Implementation Best Practices**:
   - Start with a simple 5-7 touch sequence focused on education and value
   - Include periodic "check-in" messages that invite direct response
   - Incorporate seasonal or trigger-based content relevant to the lead's industry
   - Use progressive profiling to gather additional information over time
   - Maintain consistent branding while varying content formats
   - Include clear paths for leads to indicate renewed interest

8. **Example Workflow: "Hibernating Lead Nurture"**:
   - **Day 1**: Welcome email explaining the value-focused content they'll receive
   - **Day 7**: Industry-specific insight or trend report
   - **Day 21**: Case study relevant to their business challenges
   - **Day 35**: Invitation to upcoming webinar or resource library
   - **Day 60**: "Quick check-in" with easy response options
   - **Day 90**: Personalized value proposition based on accumulated data
   - **Day 120**: Final "stay in touch" message with future-focused options
   - **Conditional**: Any engagement above threshold triggers sales team notification

This automated approach ensures that low probability leads receive appropriate attention without diverting resources from higher-probability opportunities, while maintaining the possibility of future conversion when timing or circumstances change.

2. Ask questions about:
   - Lead information
   - System features
   - Data analysis
   - Recommendations
   - User manual and help documentation
   - Database queries in natural language
3. The chatbot can:

   - Troubleshoot common issues by referencing documentation
   - Convert natural language questions into database queries

#### Natural Language Database Queries

One of the most powerful features of the STRIKE chatbot is its ability to translate natural language questions into SQL database queries. This allows you to retrieve information from your CRM database without needing to know SQL:

1. **Ask Data Questions Naturally**: Simply ask questions like:
   - "How many leads do we have from the technology sector?"
   - "Show me all tasks assigned to Sarah that are due this week"
   - "What's the average lead score for leads acquired in the last month?"
   - "Which sales rep has the highest conversion rate this quarter?"

2. **How It Works**:
   - The chatbot analyzes your question to determine if it requires database access
   - It automatically generates an appropriate SQL query
   - The query is executed securely against your database
   - Results are formatted and presented in a readable format
   - The chatbot provides additional context and insights about the data

3. **Security Measures**:
   - All queries are limited to read-only operations (SELECT statements only)
   - Queries are sanitized to prevent SQL injection
   - Access is restricted based on user permissions
   - All database interactions are logged for security auditing

4. **Example Interactions**:

   *User*: "How many high-priority tasks are overdue?"
   
   *Chatbot*: "There are 12 high-priority tasks currently overdue. Here's the breakdown by assignee:
   - John Smith: 5 tasks
   - Sarah Johnson: 4 tasks
   - Michael Brown: 3 tasks
   
   Would you like to see the details of these tasks?"

### Lead Scoring

STRIKE uses a sophisticated AI-powered lead scoring system to help you prioritize your sales efforts:

1. **Scoring Range**: Leads are scored on a scale of 1-100:
   - 80-100: Hot leads (high probability of conversion)
   - 50-79: Warm leads (moderate probability)
   - 20-49: Cool leads (lower probability)
   - 1-19: Cold leads (very low probability)

2. **Scoring Factors**: The AI considers multiple data points when calculating scores:
   - **Engagement Metrics** (40% weight):
     - Email open and response rates
     - Website visits (frequency and duration)
     - Content downloads and interaction
     - Form submissions
     - Chat interactions
   
   - **Demographic Fit** (25% weight):
     - Industry alignment with your target markets
     - Company size and revenue
     - Job title and decision-making authority
     - Geographic location
   
   - **Behavioral Signals** (20% weight):
     - Specific pages visited (pricing, product details)
     - Time spent on high-intent pages
     - Repeated visits to key conversion pages
     - Engagement with bottom-funnel content
    
   - **Communication Sentiment** (10% weight):
     - Positive language in communications
     - Response time to your outreach
     - Questions indicating buying intent
   
   - **External Data** (5% weight):
     - Social media activity
     - Company news and growth indicators
     - Market conditions

3. **Score Visibility**:
   - Lead scores are prominently displayed on lead cards and profiles
   - Color-coding provides quick visual reference (red: cold, yellow: cool, green: warm, blue: hot)
   - Hover over scores to see a breakdown of contributing factors
   - Historical score tracking shows progression over time

4. **Using Lead Scores**:
   - Sort lead lists by score to prioritize outreach
   - Filter dashboard views to focus on specific score ranges
   - Set up alerts for score changes above a certain threshold
   - Create segments based on score ranges for targeted campaigns
   - Track conversion rates by initial and current scores

5. **Score Recalculation**:
   - Scores are automatically updated daily
   - Significant interactions trigger immediate recalculation
   - Manual recalculation can be triggered from the lead profile

6. **Score Customization**:
   - Administrators can adjust factor weights in Settings > Lead Scoring
   - Industry-specific scoring models can be selected
   - Custom scoring factors can be added based on your unique business needs
   - A/B test different scoring models to optimize for your sales process

### Automated Workflows for Low Probability Clients

STRIKE includes powerful automation capabilities specifically designed to nurture low probability leads efficiently without consuming valuable sales team resources:

1. **Low Probability Classification**:
   - Leads with scores below 30 are automatically classified as low probability
   - Leads showing declining engagement patterns over 30 days
   - Leads that have explicitly indicated long future timeframes
   - Leads that match your configured exclusion criteria

2. **Automated Nurture Campaigns**:
   - **Activation**: Low probability leads are automatically enrolled in specialized nurture campaigns
   - **Content Delivery**: Scheduled delivery of educational content, case studies, and industry insights
   - **Frequency Control**: Optimized contact frequency to maintain presence without overwhelming
   - **Multi-Channel Approach**: Coordinated outreach across email, SMS, and social touchpoints
   - **Personalization**: AI-generated personalized content based on lead characteristics and behavior

3. **Workflow Configuration**:
   - Access workflow settings in **Settings > Automation > Low Probability Workflows**
   - Create multiple workflows for different types of low probability leads
   - Set entry and exit conditions based on score thresholds and behaviors
   - Configure content sequences with conditional logic
   - Set maximum workflow duration (typically 90-180 days)
   - Define success metrics and conversion paths

4. **Monitoring and Optimization**:
   - **Performance Dashboard**: Track key metrics for low probability workflows
   - **Engagement Analytics**: Monitor open rates, click-through rates, and response patterns
   - **Conversion Tracking**: Measure how many low probability leads convert to higher scores
   - **A/B Testing**: Compare different nurture approaches for continuous improvement
   - **ROI Calculation**: Measure resource investment against conversion outcomes

5. **Re-Engagement Triggers**:
   - **Score Improvements**: Leads that reach a score of 40+ are automatically flagged for sales review
   - **Buying Signals**: Specific high-intent actions trigger alerts regardless of overall score
   - **Timing Indicators**: Responses indicating changed timeframes accelerate follow-up
   - **Manual Overrides**: Sales team can manually move leads out of automated workflows at any time

6. **Exit Strategies**:
   - **Successful Conversion**: Leads showing renewed interest move to active sales workflows
   - **Time-Based Exit**: Leads with no engagement after configured timeframe (default: 120 days)
   - **Explicit Opt-Out**: Leads requesting no further contact
   - **Disqualification**: Leads confirmed as poor fits after additional data collection

7. **Implementation Best Practices**:
   - Start with a simple 5-7 touch sequence focused on education and value
   - Include periodic "check-in" messages that invite direct response
   - Incorporate seasonal or trigger-based content relevant to the lead's industry
   - Use progressive profiling to gather additional information over time
   - Maintain consistent branding while varying content formats
   - Include clear paths for leads to indicate renewed interest

8. **Example Workflow: "Hibernating Lead Nurture"**:
   - **Day 1**: Welcome email explaining the value-focused content they'll receive
   - **Day 7**: Industry-specific insight or trend report
   - **Day 21**: Case study relevant to their business challenges
   - **Day 35**: Invitation to upcoming webinar or resource library
   - **Day 60**: "Quick check-in" with easy response options
   - **Day 90**: Personalized value proposition based on accumulated data
   - **Day 120**: Final "stay in touch" message with future-focused options
   - **Conditional**: Any engagement above threshold triggers sales team notification

This automated approach ensures that low probability leads receive appropriate attention without diverting resources from higher-probability opportunities, while maintaining the possibility of future conversion when timing or circumstances change.

2. Ask questions about:
   - Lead information
   - System features
   - Data analysis
   - Recommendations
   - User manual and help documentation
   - Database queries in natural language
3. The chatbot can:

   - Troubleshoot common issues by referencing documentation
   - Convert natural language questions into database queries

#### Natural Language Database Queries

One of the most powerful features of the STRIKE chatbot is its ability to translate natural language questions into SQL database queries. This allows you to retrieve information from your CRM database without needing to know SQL:

1. **Ask Data Questions Naturally**: Simply ask questions like:
   - "How many leads do we have from the technology sector?"
   - "Show me all tasks assigned to Sarah that are due this week"
   - "What's the average lead score for leads acquired in the last month?"
   - "Which sales rep has the highest conversion rate this quarter?"

2. **How It Works**:
   - The chatbot analyzes your question to determine if it requires database access
   - It automatically generates an appropriate SQL query
   - The query is executed securely against your database
   - Results are formatted and presented in a readable format
   - The chatbot provides additional context and insights about the data

3. **Security Measures**:
   - All queries are limited to read-only operations (SELECT statements only)
   - Queries are sanitized to prevent SQL injection
   - Access is restricted based on user permissions
   - All database interactions are logged for security auditing

4. **Example Interactions**:

   *User*: "How many high-priority tasks are overdue?"
   
   *Chatbot*: "There are 12 high-priority tasks currently overdue. Here's the breakdown by assignee:
   - John Smith: 5 tasks
   - Sarah Johnson: 4 tasks
   - Michael Brown: 3 tasks
   
   Would you like to see the details of these tasks?"

   *User*: "Show me leads from California with a score above 80"
   
   *Chatbot*: "I found 8 leads from California with a score above 80. Here are the top 3 by score:
   1. Acme Corporation (Score: 95) - Last contacted: 2 days ago
   2. TechSolutions Inc (Score: 92) - Last contacted: 1 week ago
   3. Pacific Innovations (Score: 88) - Last contacted: 3 days ago
   
   Would you like to see the full list or get more details about any of these leads?"

#### Chatbot Interface Controls

The chatbot interface includes several controls for easy interaction:

1. **Minimize Button**: Click the minimize button (−) in the top-right corner of the chatbot window to collapse it back to the chat icon. You can reopen it anytime by clicking the chat icon again.
2. **Clear Conversation**: Click the trash icon to clear the current conversation history and start fresh.
3. **Copy to Clipboard**: Each message has a copy icon that appears on hover, allowing you to copy specific responses.
4. **Feedback Buttons**: After receiving a response, you can provide feedback using the thumbs up/down buttons.
5. **Expand/Collapse**: Some responses, especially those with multiple steps or sections, can be expanded or collapsed for easier reading.
6. **Draggable Window**: The chatbot window can be moved anywhere on the screen by clicking and dragging the header bar. By default, the chatbot opens in the lower right corner of the screen in a visible area, and will automatically stay within the screen boundaries when dragged.

#### Using the Chatbot for Help

The chatbot is integrated with this user manual and can provide contextual help:

1. Ask questions like "How do I import leads?" or "What is lead scoring?"
2. Request walkthroughs: "Guide me through setting up email integration"
3. Get troubleshooting help: "I'm having trouble logging in"
4. Access feature explanations: "Explain how sentiment analysis works"
5. Find specific sections: "Show me the task management section of the manual"

The chatbot will extract relevant information from this manual and present it in a conversational format, making it easier to find the help you need without leaving your current workflow.

### Chatbot-Manual Integration

The STRIKE chatbot is deeply integrated with this user manual through several advanced features:

#### Knowledge Base Integration

The chatbot has been trained on the entire contents of this user manual, allowing it to:

1. **Retrieve Specific Sections**: Request exact sections from the manual with commands like "Show me section 4.2 on Email Integration"
2. **Contextual Search**: Ask questions in natural language and receive relevant manual excerpts
3. **Visual Aids**: Request screenshots or diagrams from the manual for visual guidance

#### Interactive Tutorials

3. **Feature Explanation**: "Explain how lead scoring works according to the manual"
4. **Contextual Help**: "I'm on the lead details page, what can I do here?"
5. **Manual Navigation**: "What topics are covered in section 7?"
6. **Comparative Information**: "What's the difference between SMS messaging and email integration?"
7. **Visual Guidance**: "Show me a screenshot of the dashboard analytics"
8. **Update Requests**: "The information about calendar integration seems outdated"

### Lead Scoring

STRIKE uses a sophisticated AI-powered lead scoring system to help you prioritize your sales efforts:

   - 80-100: Hot leads (high probability of conversion)
   - 50-79: Warm leads (moderate probability)
   - 20-49: Cool leads (lower probability)
   - 1-19: Cold leads (very low probability)

2. **Scoring Factors**: The AI considers multiple data points when calculating scores:

     - Market conditions

3. **Score Visibility**:
   - Lead scores are prominently displayed on lead cards and profiles
   - Color-coding provides quick visual reference (red: cold, yellow: cool, green: warm, blue: hot)
   - Hover over scores to see a breakdown of contributing factors
   - Historical score tracking shows progression over time

4. **Using Lead Scores**:
   - Sort lead lists by score to prioritize outreach
   - Filter dashboard views to focus on specific score ranges
   - Set up alerts for score changes above a certain threshold
   - Create segments based on score ranges for targeted campaigns
   - Track conversion rates by initial and current scores

5. **Score Recalculation**:
   - Scores are automatically updated daily
   - Significant interactions trigger immediate recalculation
   - Manual recalculation can be triggered from the lead profile

6. **Score Customization**:
   - Administrators can adjust factor weights in Settings > Lead Scoring

   - **Buying Signals**: Specific high-intent actions trigger alerts regardless of overall score
   - **Timing Indicators**: Responses indicating changed timeframes accelerate follow-up
   - **Manual Overrides**: Sales team can manually move leads out of automated workflows at any time

6. **Exit Strategies**:
   - **Successful Conversion**: Leads showing renewed interest move to active sales workflows
   - **Time-Based Exit**: Leads with no engagement after configured timeframe (default: 120 days)
   - **Explicit Opt-Out**: Leads requesting no further contact
   - **Disqualification**: Leads confirmed as poor fits after additional data collection

7. **Implementation Best Practices**:
   - Start with a simple 5-7 touch sequence focused on education and value
   - Include periodic "check-in" messages that invite direct response
   - Incorporate seasonal or trigger-based content relevant to the lead's industry
   - Use progressive profiling to gather additional information over time
   - Maintain consistent branding while varying content formats
   - Include clear paths for leads to indicate renewed interest

8. **Example Workflow: "Hibernating Lead Nurture"**:
   - **Day 1**: Welcome email explaining the value-focused content they'll receive
   - **Day 7**: Industry-specific insight or trend report
   - **Day 21**: Case study relevant to their business challenges
   - **Day 35**: Invitation to upcoming webinar or resource library
   - **Day 60**: "Quick check-in" with easy response options
   - **Day 90**: Personalized value proposition based on accumulated data
   - **Day 120**: Final "stay in touch" message with future-focused options
   - **Conditional**: Any engagement above threshold triggers sales team notification

This automated approach ensures that low probability leads receive appropriate attention without diverting resources from higher-probability opportunities, while maintaining the possibility of future conversion when timing or circumstances change.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Login Problems**
- Ensure you're using the correct email and password
- Check if Caps Lock is enabled
- Try the "Forgot Password" option
- Clear browser cache and cookies

**Data Import Issues**
- Verify your CSV or Excel file follows the required format
- Check for special characters that might cause parsing errors
- Ensure required fields are included
- For large imports, try splitting into smaller batches

**Phone Extension Dialing Issues**
- If extensions aren't being dialed correctly:
  - Ensure the extension contains only numeric characters
  - Check that there's sufficient pause time (default is 2 seconds)
  - Verify the main phone number is in a valid format
  - Try adding additional pauses by including commas in the extension (each comma adds a 1-second pause)
- If you're unable to save an extension:
  - Ensure you're using the dedicated extension field, not adding it to the main phone field
  - Extensions should be limited to 20 characters maximum
  - Only numeric characters, commas, and the # symbol are supported in extensions

- Check for email server issues or outages
