1. **Mock Data System**:
   - **Global Mock Data Toggle**: Enable or disable mock data throughout the application
   - When enabled, all components using the standardized approach will use mock data
   - When disabled, the system will use real data from the database
   - The setting is stored in:
     - User preferences in the database
     - LocalStorage for persistence between sessions
     - A global variable for real-time access
   - Changes take effect immediately across the entire application
   - A banner appears when mock data is enabled
   - **Standardized Implementation**:
     - All components use the `useMockData` hook from `/hooks/useMockData.ts`
     - Non-React contexts use the `getMockDataStatus` function from `/lib/utils/mockDataUtils.ts`
     - Real-time updates through custom events when settings change
     - Consistent behavior across the entire application
   - **Feature-Specific Mock Data**:
     - **Company Analysis**: Toggle mock data specifically for company analysis features
     - **Auto-Trigger Analysis**: Toggle automatic triggering of analysis when viewing leads
